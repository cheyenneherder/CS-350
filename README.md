# CS-350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The project involved developing a smart thermostat system capable of monitoring and controlling environmental temperatures through a network of sensors. The primary goal was to enhance comfort and energy efficiency by automating temperature adjustments based on real-time data and predefined user settings. The system was designed to be compatible with various hardware architectures, including TI, Microchip, and Freescale, and to connect to the cloud via Wi-Fi, allowing for remote monitoring and management.

What did you do particularly well?

One area where I excelled was in integrating multiple hardware components and ensuring compatibility across different platforms. I meticulously implemented the communication protocolS, which were crucial for the sensors and peripheral interactions. My attention to detail in the setup of GPIOs for user input and feedback mechanisms also ensured that the system was user-friendly and responsive.

Where could you improve?

While the project was successful, there is always room for improvement. One area I could enhance is the cloud connectivity aspect. The current implementation covers basic functionalities; however, expanding the cloud capabilities to include more robust data analytics and machine learning could significantly increase the system's predictive capabilities and efficiency.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

In this project, I relied on essential tools and resources that I'll keep using: 
1. CCS (Code Composer Studio) was vital for coding and debugging.
2. Platforms like Stack Overflow forums were key for troubleshooting and expert advice.
3. Datasheets and documentation were crucial for understanding hardware and software capabilities effectively.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?

I've gained valuable skills from this project that will be beneficial in other areas:
Cross-platform Development: Adapting code for different hardware platforms prepares me for future IoT and embedded systems projects.
Systems Integration: Integrating hardware and software components enhances my ability to design and implement complex systems across engineering fields.
Problem-solving: Developing a custom task scheduler and tackling real-time data processing challenges has helped my problem-solving skills.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I ensured project longevity and ease of maintenance by organizing code into modular components, maintaining thorough documentation, and adhering to consistent coding standards.
